Kindly note this submission of quoco-jms executes till Task 3
which is individually running all the services to get the quoations.
I have implemented task 4 , however couldn't make it work due to 
some wrong logic perphas. Rem asked me to make two submissons one with 
partial implementaton of task 4 so that i could be considered for a better 
grade. I have made changes in client as well as broker, implemented the threads too.


For executing quoco-jms (Kindly make sure the path is correct)
- mvn clean install
- mvn compile 
- mvn compile exec:java -pl auldfellas
- mvn compile exec:java -pl girlpower 
- mvn compile exec:java -pl dodgydrivers 
- mvn compile exec:java -pl client
