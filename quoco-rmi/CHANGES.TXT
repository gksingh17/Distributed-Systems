Mainly followed instructions from the PDFs.
However, some instruction package names did not match code snippet package names, hence I modified them as needed. 
Added toString() method to the ClientInfo and QuatationService classes for debugging purposes.
Added Maven Assembly plugin in all pom.xml files to make jar including dependencies. 
Reformatted code. 

To run the project:
- mvn install 
- mvn exec:java -pl broker
- mvn exec:java -pl <NAME_OF_QUOATATION_SERVICE> "-Dexec.args=localhost"
- mvn exec:java -pl client "-Dexec.args=localhost"

To run the project (using Docker):
- mvn install 
- mvn package
- docker-compose build --no-cache
- docker-compose up
